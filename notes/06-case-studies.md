Analyzing real-world breaches to understand offensive and defensive lessons.

## Example Case Studies
1. **Phishing campaign against a financial institution**  
   - Attack vector: spear-phishing with malicious attachments.  
   - Defense gap: weak employee awareness and lack of sandboxing.  

2. **Supply chain attack on software updates**  
   - Attack vector: compromised update server.  
   - Defense gap: insufficient code-signing validation.  

3. **Healthcare ransomware outbreak**  
   - Attack vector: unpatched systems and weak backups.  
   - Defense gap: lack of segmentation and poor incident response readiness.  

## Lessons Learned
- Always assume breach mindset.  
- Strengthen people, process, and technology layers.  
- Continuous testing and improvement.
