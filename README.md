## 📝 Personal Review  

This course was an excellent introduction to **thinking like an attacker** while simultaneously learning how to **defend as a blue teamer**.  
I found the **Red vs Blue simulation lab** particularly engaging, as it provided a hands-on perspective on offensive vs defensive operations.  
The **social engineering module** highlighted the importance of human factors in cybersecurity, a reminder that technology alone is never enough.  

Overall, I would recommend this program to anyone wanting a **balanced approach to offensive & defensive security**.
