# ðŸ§ª Lab: Red vs Blue Simulation

A hands-on exercise to simulate attacker and defender roles.

## Objectives
- Experience attacker (Red Team) tactics.  
- Strengthen defender (Blue Team) monitoring and response skills.  
- Enhance collaboration via Purple Team approach.  

## Steps
1. Red Team executes a simulated attack (phishing, scanning, privilege escalation).  
2. Blue Team monitors logs and alerts to detect activity.  
3. Blue Team applies incident response actions.  
4. Debrief and discuss gaps.  

## Expected Outcome
- Identification of monitoring blind spots.  
- Improved detection and incident handling.  
- Collaborative learning between teams.
